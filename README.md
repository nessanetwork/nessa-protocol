### What is Nessa Network?

***The infrastructure for automating dapp****

**Nessa Network** is a decentralized bots network that connects all existing blockchains with unlimited throughput used by web3 developers to automate smart contract executions on blockchains. 

Using Nessa, developers can outsource their web3 DevOps needs in order to focus exclusively on building their core product. 

### Why do I need a decentralized bots network to automate smart contracts?

Before Nessa, developers would have to build custom bots related to each specific smart contract use case they wanted to automate. Building, running, and maintaining use case-specific bots to service these systems requires a substantial amount of time & usually leads to the development team becoming the central point of failure within their system. If their bot goes down, the whole application halts.
