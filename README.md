### What is Nessa Network?

**Nessa Network** is a decentralized bots network that connects all existing blockchains with unlimited throughput used by web3 developers to automate smart contract executions on blockchains. 

Using Nessa, developers can outsource their web3 DevOps needs in order to focus exclusively on building their core product. 

### Why do I need a decentralized bots network to automate smart contracts?

Before Nessa, developers would have to build custom bots related to each specific smart contract use case they wanted to automate. Building, running, and maintaining use case-specific bots to service these systems requires a substantial amount of time & usually leads to the development team becoming the central point of failure within their system. If their bot goes down, the whole application halts. 

### Vision

The vision of Nessa is to solve the issues of lacking reliability, sophistication, and centralization around dapps that want to offer automatic smart contract executions within and across multiple blockchain networks in the web3 ecosystem. It was created to replace legacy centralized keeper systems with an easy to use interface and reliable infrastructure to power the next generation of DeFi, NFT and gaming application in web3.
